You can checkout the the official Flutter documentation on [getting started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for help.

## Setting Up and Running Examples

### Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter`

### Try running the example Flutter Project

Checkout the [set up and editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) and [test drive](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive) sections of the official Flutter documentation on setting up your environment.
